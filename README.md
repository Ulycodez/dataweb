In your portfolio project, create a file called README.md. This can be thought of as the "front page" of your project. It's commonly written in a format called Markdown, but you can format it however you like (use README.txt instead for plain text).

The API i used for 'website' table is GET, POST, DELETE, AND PATCH. As well for customers GET. For 'website' the parameters include id, name, and niche. 

Retrospective answering of the following questions:
How did the project's design evolve over time?
Initially the project was a guessing game. I attempted to do without much thought for how the peices work together and it looked like a mess. With the help of other students it became clearer how the models.py __init__.py and their corresposnding 'py's. all worked togerther to create API's 

Did you choose to use an ORM or raw SQL? Why?
I chose ORM because it was easier for  me to implement my code and read it's better for scalability in the future.

What future improvements are in store, if any?
Future improvement would be vizualizations. such as what websites have more users and products are selling using a line chart and pie charts. This would help Decision makers decide whethr or not theyd like to expand their markets in certain direction.
